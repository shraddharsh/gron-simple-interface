# gron-simple-interface
Uses Gron to parse JSON and display the output in a simple ul

This tool is a very very simple single file application to just get the output of a JSON file using gron

Check the following link for: https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron

download the gron file and move it to any folder and then edit that in the file where it says command (variable)

I've used PHP, bootstrap, HTML you can edit, make changes the way you want them to be.

I've commented wherever necessary in the file.
